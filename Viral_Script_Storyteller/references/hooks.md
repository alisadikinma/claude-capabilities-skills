## Hook Writing Framework

### Step 1: Identify Core Value
What's the ONE thing viewers will gain?

### Step 2: Choose Hook Type
Match hook category to content type

### Step 3: Add Specificity
Replace generic with specific:
- "this trick" → "this 3-line Python decorator"
- "faster" → "10x faster (500ms to 50ms)"
- "better" → "99.99% uptime vs 95%"

### Step 4: Test Against Criteria
- [ ] Under 5 seconds to say?
- [ ] Creates curiosity gap?
- [ ] Relevant to target audience?
- [ ] Specific and concrete?
- [ ] Emotionally engaging?
