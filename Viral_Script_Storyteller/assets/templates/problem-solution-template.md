# Problem-Solution Script Template
**Format:** Short-form viral  
**Duration:** 15-30 seconds  
**Best for:** Quick tips, hacks, pain point solutions

---

## SCRIPT STRUCTURE

### [0-3s] HOOK (Problem Shock)
**Visual:** Frustrated face OR broken code/error screen

```
🎯 Hook Formula:
"[Painful problem]? [Here's why you've been doing it wrong]"

Examples:
- "Spending hours debugging? You're missing this one thing"
- "Git merge conflicts destroying your day? This command fixes it"
- "CSS centering driving you crazy? Flexbox is NOT the answer"
```

**Shot Type:** Close-up face (exaggerated frustration) OR zoom into error  
**Text Overlay:** Problem in BIG BOLD text  
**Music:** Tension build

---

### [3-15s] SOLUTION (The Reveal)
**Visual:** Solution demonstrated live

```
📝 Script Formula:
"[Simple action] + [Why it works] + [Immediate result]"

Examples:
- "Just add this breakpoint. It pauses execution exactly where you need. No more console.logs everywhere."
- "Use 'git rerere'. It remembers how you resolved conflicts. Auto-applies next time."
- "Grid center with 'place-items: center'. One line. Works every time. No more margin hacks."
```

**Shot Type:** Screen recording with highlighted action  
**Text Overlay:** 
- Code/command highlighted yellow
- Key phrase animated: "ONE LINE", "NO MORE X"
**Music:** Resolution, satisfaction tone

---

### [15-18s] PROOF (Show Result)
**Visual:** Before vs After OR metric comparison

```
📝 Script Formula:
"[Concrete result] in [specific timeframe]"

Examples:
- "Bug found in 30 seconds. Not 3 hours."
- "Zero conflicts since. Merged 50+ branches smooth."
- "Perfect center. Every browser. First try."
```

**Shot Type:** Split screen before/after OR metric overlay  
**Text Overlay:** Numbers zoomed in (3hrs → 30s)  
**SFX:** Success chime

---

### [18-30s] CTA (Action Command)
**Visual:** Face direct to camera OR pin icon

```
📝 CTA Formula:
"[Low-friction action] + [Specific benefit you proved]"

Examples:
- "Save this. Next bug takes 30 seconds, not 3 hours"
- "Follow for Git tricks that actually save time"
- "Share with someone fighting CSS. They'll thank you"
```

**Shot Type:** Medium shot, eye contact  
**Text Overlay:** CTA verb animated (SAVE, FOLLOW, SHARE)  
**Ending:** Freeze frame with CTA button highlighted

---

## PACING RULES (CRITICAL)

| Timing | Rule | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| 0-3s | **Change visual every 1-2s** | Pattern interrupt, stop scroll |
| 3-15s | **Show, don't tell** | Demonstration > explanation |
| 15-18s | **Visual proof only** | Numbers speak louder than words |
| 18-30s | **One CTA, no rambling** | Confusion kills conversion |

## PRODUCTION CHECKLIST

**Pre-Production:**
- [ ] Problem is SPECIFIC (not "debugging is hard" but "finding WHERE bug happens")
- [ ] Solution is ONE thing (not 3 steps)
- [ ] Result is MEASURABLE (not "better" but "30 seconds vs 3 hours")
- [ ] CTA promises the result, not generic

**During Shoot:**
- [ ] Camera stable (tripod or stabilizer)
- [ ] Lighting consistent (no shadows on face)
- [ ] Audio clean (lav mic or boom, no echo)
- [ ] Screen recordings 60fps minimum

**Post-Production:**
- [ ] Cut dead air ruthlessly (pauses <0.5s)
- [ ] Text overlays pop (scale in, not fade)
- [ ] Color grade for pop (increase saturation 10-15%)
- [ ] Sound effects on key moments:
  - Error sound on problem
  - Typing sounds on solution
  - Chime on result
  - Whoosh on CTA

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Read aloud <30s? (If not, cut words)
- [ ] First 3s grabs attention? (Test with friends)
- [ ] Can understand without audio? (Captions critical)
- [ ] CTA is specific action? (Not "like and subscribe")

```
[0-3s] HOOK
VISUAL: Merge conflict red everywhere

## VIRALITY MULTIPLIERS

**Add these for 2-3x more engagement:**

1. **Unexpected Result**
   - "Wait for it..." at 8-10s mark
   - Creates anticipation loop

2. **Relatability Peak**
   - Show your OWN frustration first
   - "I wasted 6 months before learning this"

3. **Visual Shock**
   - Metrics jump dramatically (2000ms → 50ms)
   - Green checkmarks slam in
   - Code/error fills entire screen

4. **Controversy Angle**
   - "Everyone says use X. They're wrong."
   - Triggers comment debates

5. **Personality Injection**
   - Quick smile after solving
   - Fist bump camera
   - "Let's goooo!" celebration

**Remember:** Problem-solution format lives or dies on the PROBLEM hook. If viewer doesn't feel the pain in 3 seconds, they scroll. Make the pain VISCERAL.
