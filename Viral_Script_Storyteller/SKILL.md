## The 3-Part Viral Formula

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HOOK (0-5s)  →  BODY (10-50s)  →  CTA (Last 3-5s)   │
│  ↓                ↓                  ↓                  │
│  Grab            Deliver            Convert             │
│  Attention       Value               Action              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Part 1: The Hook (0-5 seconds) - CRITICAL

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll. Create pattern interrupt. Generate curiosity gap.

**Hook Types:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Shock** | "You're doing [X] wrong..." | "You're deploying AI models completely wrong" |
| **Curiosity** | "This [simple thing] will..." | "This 3-line code snippet will 10x your API speed" |
| **Problem-Agitate** | "Struggling with [pain]?" | "Struggling with Docker errors that make no sense?" |
| **Transformation** | "How I went from [A] to [B]" | "How I went from 10k to 1M requests/second" |
| **Contrarian** | "Forget everything about [X]" | "Forget everything you know about React hooks" |
| **Secret** | "Nobody tells you about [X]" | "Nobody tells you about this Kubernetes trick" |

**Visual Hook Techniques:**
- Fast-paced B-roll in first 2 seconds
- Text overlay with power words (FREE, MISTAKE, SECRET, HACK)
- Unexpected visual (code breaking, graph spiking)
- Face close-up with expressive emotion

### Part 2: Story Body (10-50 seconds)

**The E.A.S.Y. Framework:**

1. **Establish** (2-5s): Set context
   - "When building my startup's backend..."
   - "Every developer faces this..."

2. **Amplify** (10-30s): Build tension or deliver value
   - Short-form: Show 1 problem → 1 solution
   - Tutorial: 3-step process with visuals
   - Explainer: Analogy → Technical → Result

3. **Simplify** (5-10s): Make it click
   - Use visual metaphors
   - Show before/after comparison
   - Demonstrate live example

4. **Yield** (3-5s): Deliver payoff
   - "And that's how you..."
   - "This simple change resulted in..."

### Part 3: CTA (Last 3-5 seconds) - CONVERSION

**Effective CTA Formula:**
```
[Action Verb] + [Specific Benefit] + [Low Friction]

✓ "Follow for daily AI tips that actually work"
✓ "Save this to build your first RAG system"
✓ "Comment 'CODE' for the full template"
✗ "Like and subscribe" (too generic)
✗ "Check out my course" (high friction)
```

**CTA Types by Platform:**

| Platform | Best CTA | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| TikTok | "Duet this" / "Comment [word]" | Engagement algorithm boost |
| YouTube Shorts | "Subscribe for Part 2" | Cliffhanger retention |
| Instagram Reels | "Save this for later" | Private signal to algorithm |
| LinkedIn | "Repost if this helps" | Professional sharing culture |

## Technical → Simple Translation Framework

**The Analogy Bridge™**

```
Complex Concept → Everyday Analogy → Visual Representation → Technical Truth

Example 1: Docker Containers
├─ Concept: "Isolated runtime environments"
├─ Analogy: "Like shipping containers for code"
├─ Visual: Show physical container → code container side-by-side
└─ Truth: "Bundles dependencies so it runs anywhere"

Example 2: API Rate Limiting
├─ Concept: "Request throttling mechanism"
├─ Analogy: "Like a club bouncer controlling entry speed"
├─ Visual: Bouncer at door → code throttling requests
└─ Truth: "Prevents server overload with request caps"
```

**Simplification Rules:**

1. **One concept per video** (especially short-form)
2. **Show, don't explain** (code running > code explanation)
3. **Use power words** (instead of "optimize" → "10x faster")
4. **Concrete numbers** ("3 lines" > "a few lines")
5. **Active voice** ("Deploy in 5 minutes" > "Can be deployed quickly")

## Quick Start Checklist

**Before writing any script:**
- [ ] Who is the audience? (beginners, intermediate, advanced)
- [ ] What's the ONE takeaway?
- [ ] What problem does this solve?
- [ ] Why should they care in 3 seconds?
- [ ] What action should they take after watching?

**Quality Control:**
- [ ] Script under 60 seconds when read aloud?
- [ ] Hook generates curiosity/surprise?
- [ ] No jargon without explanation?
- [ ] Visual cues clear for editor?
- [ ] CTA specific and low-friction?
- [ ] Tested with non-technical person for clarity?

## Key Principles

1. **Hook is king** - If they skip in 3 seconds, the rest doesn't matter
2. **One concept only** - Complexity kills retention
3. **Show > Tell** - Visual proof beats explanation
4. **Simplify ruthlessly** - If a 12-year-old can't understand, rewrite
5. **CTA must convert** - Generic CTAs waste the entire video's potential

**Remember:** The best viral scripts feel effortless but are strategically engineered. Every word, every visual, every pause serves the formula: Hook → Value → Action.
