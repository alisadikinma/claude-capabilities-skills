## Comments & Observations

[PM's qualitative assessment and context not captured elsewhere]

[Paragraph format observations about project health, team dynamics, stakeholder engagement, emerging patterns, or strategic considerations.]

Example:
*"This reporting period marks a turning point in project momentum. The completion of the authentication module removes our biggest technical risk, and team velocity has stabilized at a sustainable 30 points/sprint. However, growing concerns around user adoption require proactive change management. We've initiated a champions network with 15 early adopters who will help drive organic adoption across the organization. The 5-day schedule slip on development is manageable given our buffer, but we're closely monitoring the UAT timeline as it's now on the critical path."*
