## Interview Techniques

### Active Listening

**DO:**
- ✅ Make eye contact and give full attention
- ✅ Take notes on key points, not verbatim
- ✅ Nod and use verbal affirmations ("I see," "That makes sense")
- ✅ Pause before responding (allow stakeholder to continue)
- ✅ Repeat back what you heard for confirmation

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Interrupt or finish their sentences
- ❌ Multitask (check email, phone)
- ❌ Jump to solutions prematurely
- ❌ Argue or defend current state
- ❌ Use jargon they may not understand

### Probing Techniques

**When responses are vague:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Walk me through a recent time when this happened."

**When uncovering root causes:**
- "Why is that important?"
- "What would happen if we didn't address this?"
- "What's the underlying reason for [symptom]?"
- **Five Whys:** Keep asking "why" to get to root cause

**When clarifying requirements:**
- "If I understand correctly, you need [restate requirement]—is that right?"
- "How would you prioritize [A] vs. [B]?"
- "What would an ideal solution look like?"

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Stakeholder is vague or unfocused:**
- Use closed questions to narrow down: "Is [X] or [Y] more important?"
- Provide examples: "For instance, would you need to [scenario]?"
- Use mockups or prototypes to anchor discussion

**Stakeholder wants everything:**
- Ask about trade-offs: "If we had to choose, would you prefer [A] or [B]?"
- Use MoSCoW: "Help me understand what's Must-Have vs. Should-Have."
- Discuss timeline/budget constraints: "Given [constraint], what's most critical?"

**Stakeholder is negative about project:**
- Acknowledge concerns: "I hear your skepticism about [X]."
- Ask about root of concern: "What specifically worries you?"
- Explore alternative approaches: "What would make this more acceptable?"
- Find common ground: "What outcome would you want to see?"

**Stakeholder goes off-topic:**
- Politely redirect: "That's interesting—let's capture that separately. Back to [topic]..."
- Use parking lot: "Let me note that for follow-up. For now, can we focus on [topic]?"
- Acknowledge and move on: "Good point. I want to make sure we cover [priority topic] in our time."
