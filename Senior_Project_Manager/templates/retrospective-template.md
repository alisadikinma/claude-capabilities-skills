### Key Insights
[1-2 paragraph summary of major themes, patterns, or realizations from the retrospective]

Example:
*"This sprint highlighted the value of early collaboration between dev and QA. Stories where QA was involved from day one had 50% fewer defects. However, we continue to struggle with scope creep mid-sprint, suggesting our backlog refinement needs strengthening. Moving forward, we'll implement a formal change request process and dedicate more time to refinement sessions."*
