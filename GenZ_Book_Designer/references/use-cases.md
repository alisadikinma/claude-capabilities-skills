1. **Specific timeframes** (30 days, 90 days, 6 months)
2. **Measurable outcomes** ($10K, 100K followers, 4-hour workday)
3. **Action-first approach** (challenges in every chapter)
4. **Visual-heavy design** (30-60 illustrations minimum)
5. **Conversational tone** (like talking to a friend)
6. **Pit stops every 1,200-1,500 words**
7. **Real examples and case studies**
8. **Templates and tools included**

### Adaptation Framework

To adapt any of these use cases:

1. **Swap the niche** (same structure, different topic)
2. **Adjust target age** (change examples, references)
3. **Modify timeframe** (30 days → 90 days)
4. **Change outcome metric** ($10K → 100K followers)
5. **Personalize visual style** (match your brand)
